 ShopEase Data Engineering Project
 Overview
The ShopEase Data Engineering Project demonstrates advanced data engineering skills applied to real-world e-commerce sales data. The project is designed to help ShopEase, an e-commerce company, analyze their sales data for better business decision-making. The tasks cover key data engineering techniques using Python, SQL, and database optimization, including data loading, cleaning, manipulation, analysis, and integration with database operations like triggers and stored procedures.

Key Objectives
Python Data Engineering: Load, clean, transform, and analyze data using Pandas and NumPy.
SQL Mastery: Write complex queries with joins, subqueries, window functions, and CASE statements.
Database Optimization: Improve database performance using indexing, query optimization, and partitioning strategies.
Python and SQL Integration: Automate database operations with Python, including triggers and stored procedures.
